Some business problems/topics

# Financials

I would prefer it to be open source, because that would skyrocket its trustworthiness in the tech world, and thus its popularity. However, this may not garner enough revenue. We could do service levels and hosting of public sheets, but we will have to work that out. This is for Justin to figure out.

# Concept Threats

## Competition

Big ones are Bloomfire, Helpjuice, and Shelf. They are used by some massive companies, but are not the specific type of knowledge base we are trying to implement. I haven't seen any large KBs that are geared around very short, quick QA. But, I believe that there is a huge market for it. (Assumption that needs to be tested.)

## It is yet another tool

Thus, integration must be very easy and simple. Must be flawless and smooth. Must integrate without effort. Solution: Slack app. Instant integration into nearly every workspace, especially the big ones.

Perhaps, eventually design absorption of other knowledge bases (best one to start with: SO). This would be a heavy task, especially since our KB is designed to fill in the gaps of other KBs.

## Will it be used?

If a company adopts it, will the individual employees be motivated to use it? Several ways of ensuring the answer is yes: Have stats that show users with the most creates, edits, and deletions. Seeing stats like this presented in a pretty way taps into the human psyche, even if it is a little bit childish. We innately desire to be at the top of that list, because we are innately competitive (somewhat of an assumption, but also verified by modern psychology). Plus, managers can use this information to reward the top three players in each category, for example.

Once a sheet grows to be big enough, it will have critical momentum. Once it has been adopted and contributing to it is habit, it will be extremely useful. The difficulty is adoption.

The concept of crowdsourcing has been proven time and time again. For large projects, this will certainly work. Open source projects live off of the small desires of thousands to contribute. This is how the sheets will be built.
